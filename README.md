# About

This project is based on other open-source editors like [Parchment](https://github.com/tywil04/parchment) and [Left](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Left) while adding the following features:
- [x] theming - support for multiple baked-in themes;
- [x] drag-and-drop: open files by dragging them into the app;
- [x] menu-bar - custom menubar with common text-editor options and shortcuts;
- [x] command-bar - improved search and replace bar and text-highlighter;
- [x] custom caret - animated input-caret for a smooth writing experience;
- [ ] backup text - recover current progress in case the OS/app crashed;
- [ ] focus-mode - for distraction-free writing;

Used libraries and assets:
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - for a very performant and lightweight javascript framework;
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) - to allow for simple styling of the application;
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) - a rust wrapper that allows you to create fast and secure desktop applications using web technologies;
- [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/) & [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) - for the few icons used within this application;

# Usage
Head to the [releases](https://github.com/justDeek/leaf-editor/releases) page to download pre-built executables.

# Building

## Setup

Before you build, you need to have everything required installed.\
Follow this [guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#installing) to install Tauri and its dependencies. 

After everything is installed, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/justDeek/leaf-editor.git
cd leaf-editor
bun install
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Desktop

run: ```bun app-build```
Once the build has been completed, you will find the executables in ```src-tauri/target/release/bundle```.


## ü§ñ Android

[Android Studio and a few other steps will be required](https://v2.tauri.app/guides/prerequisites/#android) to get things up and running.
Note: When installing Android Studio via JetBrains Toolbox on Windows, the JAVA_HOME path is located at: ```C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Android Studio\jbr```

Once that's done, you can initialize the project:
```bun tauri android init```

Open Android Studio and run the development build:
```bun android-dev```

This command should open the Android emulator and the app shortly after.
If everything is working correctly, you can build the mobile app via: ```bun android-build```


## üçé iOS

[Check the prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/guides/prerequisites/#ios) for having iOS ready to run (MacOS only).

Once that is done, let‚Äôs create the XCode project:
```bun tauri ios init```

If everything runs successfully, you can start the development server:
```bun tauri ios dev --open```

This command will open XCode with your project, select the simulator and get ready to run.
